# Abstract 
The detection of buried mines is crucial for ensuring the safety of life and property. Despite various methods being employed, achieving 100% success remains elusive. The mine detection process involves sensor design, data analysis, and decision algorithm phases. The magnetic anomaly method operates by measuring anomalies in the magnetic field caused by objects, which helps determine conditions such as motion and position. This method has been utilized since the 1970s for determining parameters like position, depth, or direction of motion. 

In this study, we aim to identify the most effective algorithm for mine detection using magnetic anomaly data. This can lead to improved accuracy in identifying mines and reducing false positives. Identifying the most effective algorithms can also lead to more efficient and cost-effective mine detection processes. Algorithms that perform well can help reduce the time and resources required for mine detection operations. It can also improve the safety and reliability of mine detection operations. By reducing the need for manual detection methods, which can be dangerous and error-prone, these algorithms can help protect the lives of mine detection personnel.

Based on our research, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) seems to perform the best with the highest best score of 0.62 and the highest average accuracy in cross-validation of 0.52. We compare several machine learning algorithms to determine their accuracy in detecting mines, to improve the overall success rate of mine detection processes.
